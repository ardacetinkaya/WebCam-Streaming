# WebCam Streaming
 
This is a simple proof of concept work for demonstration of web-cam streaming in ASP.NET Core web applications, with web-sockets and also SignalR Core.
 
In this ASP.NET Core web app., there is two different approach for web-cam streams;

1. System.Net.WebSockets.WebSocket
2. SignalR Core

In first demonstration; a web-socket connection is initialized with client-side and server-side. In client-side, the web-cam streams are delivered to server-side as image frames, *.jpeg. In server-side frames' data from socket modified as grayscale and streamed back to the client-side as base64 string as image format. In client-side every frame is delivered to server with in FPS approach to have no video glitch. 

Within this demostration; within an ASP.NET Core application, basically client-side web-cam video is captured and delivered to server-side. In server-side some modification is done and send back to client-side. (Just for some fun ðŸ˜€)

In second demonstration; ASP.NET Core SignalR approached are used to stream web-cam video between two clients.
