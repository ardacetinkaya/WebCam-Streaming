# WebCam Streaming
 
This is a simple proof of concept work repository for demonstration  of usage of websockets for web-cam streaming in ASP.NET Core web applications. 
 
In this ASP.NET Core web app., the web-cam streams are delivered to the server side with websockets frame by frame. Every frame is handled as a jpeg image. In server side, every frame is modified as to be grayscale for fun.ðŸ˜€
